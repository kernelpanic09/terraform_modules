AWS Organization Terraform Module

This Terraform module provides a flexible and structured way to manage an entire AWS Organization ‚Äî including organizational units (OUs), accounts, and Service Control Policies (SCPs). It allows you to define your org hierarchy, provision AWS accounts, attach policies, and enable service access in a clean, scalable format.
üöÄ Example Usage

The following example creates an organization with:

    SCPs: dev_control_access, deny_all

    Nested OUs: CoreOU with children (DevelopmentOU, StageOU, ProductionOU) and a separate SandboxOU

    AWS accounts placed in different OUs and assigned policies

module "aws_organization" {
  source  = "cyberlabrs/aws-organization/aws"
  version = "1.0.0"

  feature_set                   = "ALL"
  aws_service_access_principals = ["sso.amazonaws.com"]
  enabled_policy_types          = ["SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY"]

  policies = [
    {
      name          = "dev_control_access",
      template_file = "./policies/scps/dev_control_access.json"
    },
    {
      name          = "deny_all",
      template_file = "./policies/scps/deny_all.json"
    }
  ]

  organizational_units = [
    {
      name     = "CoreOU",
      policies = [],
      children = [
        {
          name     = "DevelopmentOU",
          policies = ["dev_control_access"],
          children = []
        },
        {
          name     = "StageOU",
          policies = [],
          children = []
        },
        {
          name     = "ProductionOU",
          policies = [],
          children = []
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      name     = "SandboxOU",
      policies = [],
      children = []
    }
  ]

  accounts = [
    {
      name      = "AccountInRootOU",
      email     = "test+root@test.com",
      parent_id = "",
      policies  = ["deny_all"]
    },
    {
      name         = "Development",
      email        = "test+dev@test.com",
      parent_path  = "CoreOU/DevelopmentOU"
    },
    {
      name         = "Stage",
      email        = "test+stage@test.com",
      parent_path  = "CoreOU/StageOU"
    },
    {
      name         = "Production",
      email        = "test+shared@test.com",
      parent_path  = "CoreOU/ProductionOU"
    }
  ]
}
